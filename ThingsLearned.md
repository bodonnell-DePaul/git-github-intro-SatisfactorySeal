I've used Github in the past for version control on my own projects but have rarely actually worked on projects with anyone else. I've never used pull requests before so _hopefully_ I will handle that correctly.

## Questions

Is there an easy way for the class to attach a Github username to student's name? For example, my name is Josh De Ment but that doesn't really show up anyhwere on my Github profile right now. It may be better for me in the future to have a separate more professional account name.

Is there a way to make a private fork of a project? I noticed when I forked this intro originally, it created a public repository. I'm not sure if that's something that should happen in a class with individual assignments.
